# NotePad--

a little BadPad which I used during WebDev basic learning 
this helped me to not use IDE features like autocomplete
and makes me remember things better because of practising it
more than before.
I update it regularly while learning more on JavaFX.
also it needs a lot of refactoring, it's a real boilerplate code
