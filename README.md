#NotePad--

This is BadPad version of NotePad-like application and Text Editor.
I love learning HTML, CSS and JS along with Java.
Hence I think learning them in a hard way makes more affect than IDEs
that give you formatting, code-completion and other stuff to the code
and that causes having great ideas but after a while I feel like I can't remember
a lot of syntax and language's less-used elements.
So when you a kind of person like me, then you decide to create
a BadPad and name it NotePad-- üòÅ.

There is a file named `Goals.txt`, I'll regularly update it to set some
goals to achieve in the next version and delete those which achieved while
keeping it simple as it's first release to be focused more on writing than on using.

There must be also `NotePad--.jar` file
